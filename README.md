# picshare

Picshare is an app to deploy on a server with lots of storage so guests at an event can submit their 
full resolution photos without having to send numerous emails, mail USB sticks, or whatever else.

It also includes a gallery of all submitted photos, for viewing by other guests.

As the photos are uploaded the original is saved (can be retrieved by an admin), and thumbnail and
display versions are created for serving in the gallery.
